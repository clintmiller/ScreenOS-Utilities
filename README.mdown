ScreenOS Utilties
=================

The ScreenOS Utilities are a in-development collection of simple tools that I use to manage our ScreenOS firewall.

ScreenOS IP Blacklister
-----------------------

An interactive tool that takes IP addresses from the command-line (until a blank line is encountered) and generates the ScreenOS commands necessary to add the entered addresses to an Address Group. I use this group for Blacklisting abusive IPs.

`$ screenos_ipbl.pl`
